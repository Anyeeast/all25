# hid

The `lib.hid` package is for human interface devices like joysticks, button boards, etc.

Team 100 does an unusual thing with HIDs, which is that they're identified by name,
so you can change controllers (e.g. from an Xbox controller to a big joystick)
without changing code, or even restarting the code.
