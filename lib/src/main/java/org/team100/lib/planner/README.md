# Planner

The idea here is to use "Virtual Force Field" motion planning, which is a very simple method, using the distance to obstacles to generate forces on the robot. These can be attractive forces ("go to a goal") or repulsive forces ("avoid an obstacle").

There are matching commands in commands.semiauto.
