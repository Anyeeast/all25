# timing

The timing package helps to create trajectory schedules.

It is similar to the WPI package math.trajectory.constraint.

The main difference is that the input here is based on paths, without any sense of time or speed. The input is about the path, the output is about time.

In contrast, the WPI approach is to take timed input and produce adjusted timed output.

Both approaches work. Do not try to mix them.
