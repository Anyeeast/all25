# Optical Flow

This enables the use of the
[PixArt PMW3901](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/_media/projects:crazyflie2:expansionboards:pot0189-pmw3901mb-txqt-ds-r1.00-200317_20170331160807_public.pdf), which is the kind of sensor used
in an optical mouse, with a different lens, for long distances.



The code here is based on work by Team 4579, RoboEagles, specifically SailorJoe in 2018,
[described on Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/new-motion-sensor/166743)
