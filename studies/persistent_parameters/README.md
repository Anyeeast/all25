# Persistent Parameters

Experiment with Preferences, used as tuning parameters,
to allow tuning without the time-consuming process
of editing, building, deploying, and restarting.

There are two persistent files here

* networktables.json: simulation produces this file
* nttest.json: used by PersistentParameterTest to verify that persistent values are used.
