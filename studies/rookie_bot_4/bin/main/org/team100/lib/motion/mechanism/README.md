# mechanism

A Team 100 "mechanism" is comprised of

- a _motor_
- an _encoder_
- some _gears_

The idea is to encapsulate the gear ratios involved in mapping between motor behavior, encoder observations, and actual motion.  The notion of "gear ratio" should really not appear anywhere other than the "mechanism."

These classes are intended to be generally useful, but if one doesn't seem to fit your task, feel free to create another one.
