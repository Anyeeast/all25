# Interpolation

This corresponds to the end_to_end_calibration study, an experiment
to measure multi-dimensional interpolation accuracy and performance in Java.

My experiments in python indicate about 10 microseconds for a 4d->2d RBF interpolation,
and in Java it's about 10 microseconds for 4d->1d, so 20 microseconds for both outputs.
