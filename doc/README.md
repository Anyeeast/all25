# Team 100 Documentation Hub

Welcome to Team 100's learning path! This is your starting point for learning robotics programming, from complete beginner to contributing team member.

## 🚀 Getting Started - Learning Path

**New to robotics programming?** You're in the right place! We've organized our documentation to take you from complete beginner to contributing team member through a structured learning journey.

## 🎯 **What You'll Learn**

By following this learning path, you'll gain:

- **Hardware Skills**: Connecting motors, controllers, and sensors
- **Programming Skills**: Java, WPILib, robot control patterns
- **Software Engineering**: Version control, testing, debugging
- **Team Collaboration**: Code review, documentation, best practices

### 📚 **Step-by-Step Learning Journey**

Follow these chapters in order for the best learning experience:

1. **[🛠️ Setting up your development environment](README_1_STARTING.md)**
   - Install Git, VSCode, and WPILib
   - Clone the Team100/all25 repository
   - Set up your workspace and SSH keys
   - Build and simulate your first robot code

2. **[⚡ Getting your first motor running](README_2_MOTOR.md)**
   - Connect hardware (Neo motor, Spark Max controller)
   - Configure CAN IDs and motor controllers
   - Deploy code to a RoboRIO
   - Verify motor control works

3. **[🎯 Creating a new 'study'](README_3_STUDY.md)**
   - Create your first independent robot project
   - Understand the difference between competition code and studies
   - Set up a simple robot project structure
   - Learn basic robot programming concepts

4. **[🎮 Motor Control Programming](README_4_MOTOR_CONTROL.md)**
   - Write code to control motors from the RoboRIO
   - Learn about motor classes and initialization
   - Implement basic motor control commands
   - Understand duty cycles and motor feedback

5. **[🖥️ Robot Simulation](README_5_SIMULATOR.md)**
   - Test your code without physical hardware
   - Use the WPILib simulation environment
   - Debug robot behavior virtually
   - Validate your code before hardware testing

6. **[🎮 Teleoperated Control](README_6_TELEOP.md)**
   - Control your robot with joysticks
   - Implement driver controls
   - Add operator interface features
   - Create responsive robot control

### 🔧 **Advanced Topics**

Once you've mastered the basics, explore these advanced topics:

- **[🐛 Debugging Robot Code](README_N_DEBUGGING.md)** - Troubleshooting and debugging techniques
- **[🆔 Robot Identity Setup](README_N_IDENTITY.md)** - Configure hardware for specific robots
- **[📋 Coding Conventions](Conventions.md)** - Team coding standards and best practices
