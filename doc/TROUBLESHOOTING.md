# Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"git: command not found"**

- Git isn't installed or isn't in your PATH. Reinstall Git and make sure to restart your terminal.

**"Permission denied"**

- You might not have permission to write to that directory. Try using a different folder or ask for help.

**"Repository not found"**

- Check that you typed the URL correctly: `https://github.com/Team100/all25.git`
- Make sure you have internet access

**"Authentication failed"**

- This usually happens when GitHub requires authentication. For now, you can work with the code locally. We'll cover authentication later.
