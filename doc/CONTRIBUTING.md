# Contributing

This is the basic workflow to contribute changes to the shared, Team 100 repository.

1. **Make changes** in your local repository
2. **Commit changes** using GitHub Desktop (we'll show you how later)
3. **Push changes** to your fork on GitHub
4. **Create a Pull Request** to contribute your changes back to Team100/all25
